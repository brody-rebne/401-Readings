# The 3 Object Oriented Programming Principles

### Inheritance

- Enables classes to be built on other classes
- A class may have a single class called its base class
- A class based on another is called a derived class
- A class may have any number of classes derived from it
- Derived classes may have further derived classes
- Derived classes inherit properties and methods from their parents

### Abstract(ism?)

- Abstract classes are "incomplete"
- Require derived classes to be implemented
- Abstract classes can have abstract methods
- Abstract methods have no implementation, and can be overriden in a derived class
- Sealed classes cannot be derived from
- Because of this, sealed classes cannot be abstract

### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism describes the ability of objects of a derived class to function as objects of their class' base
- So, if you create an Ape class derived from the Animal class, you could use an Ape object as an argument in a method which requires an Animal

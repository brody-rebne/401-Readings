# Classes & Memory Management

## Classes

- A class is a template for objects
- An object is an instance of a class
- "A class defines a type of object, but it is not an object itself. An object is a concrete entity based on a class, and is sometimes referred to as an instance of a class."
- Platonic idealism?
- Resemble JS constructors, but are actually the conceptual wrappers around them
- Classes are used like functions to create objects
- Classes can inherit from another class
- Inherited classes are based on their base class

## Constructors

- Constructors are *actually* like JS constructors, and are used to build the shape of objects with contained values
- Constructors are written within their parent class

## Properties

- Properties allow for easy read/write access to private field values on a class
- Properties use the `get` keyword to read, and the `set` keyword to write values

## Collections

- Collections are dynamically sized groups of objects
- Better than arrays when working with groups of unknown size
- Collections are objects and so they must be instantiated
- Linked Lists, Lists, Dictionaries, and other commonly used classes are all generic collections
- Generic collections are strongly typed BUT
- Collections are not necessarily strongly typed

## Enumerations

- `enum` is a value type
- An enum is defined by a set of named constants
- These constants are counted within the enum
- By default, they are counted by ints from 0
- You can also specify specific numbers to correspond to any constant
- An enum's constant can be accessed by notation `(Enum)29` (here it's the constant of an enum called Enum which is numbered 29)
- Sort of like backwards array notation innit?

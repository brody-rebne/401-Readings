## Data Seeding
- Process of populating database with initial data
- Useful for testing database and things that use it
- Can be done 3 ways:
- #### Model Seed Data:
  - A fairly new feature (2018)
  - Allows for more automatic population of data from objects
  - Standard call: `modelBuilder.Entity<ObjType>().HasData(new ObjType { PropOne = 1, PropTwo = "value"});`
  - Limitations:
    - Primary key cannot be serialized by db, must be manually written
    - If a primary key is given which already exists, the existing data will be overwritten
- #### Manual Migration Customization
  - Manual migration of existing data into new database (?)
- #### Custom Initialization Logic
  - Saving temp(?) content to database before the main app logic starts

## Identity on ASP.NET Core

- ASP.NET Core Identity adds login functionality to .NET Core apps
- Allows for internal logins and/or external login providers
- Identity data can be stored in a SQL db or other storage services
- #### Creating authentication
  - Select an ASP.NET Core Web App, and select **Change Authentication**
  - Select **Individual User Accounts**
- #### Configuring Identities
  - Done in `ConfigureServices` method
  - Refer to [reading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#configure-identity-services-1) for configuration
- Identity services should be ready to scaffold into views and controllers
- #### [Register](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio#examine-register-1
  - Taking user input
  - Checking if successful
  - Sending email confirmation
  - Asking for email confirmation
  - Signing in with `SignInAsync()`
- #### Log in
  - Similar to register, but with optional 2-factor auth check instead of optional email confirmation, and obviously a validity check against extant logins
- #### Log out
  - Simple `SignOutAsync()` once current user is found

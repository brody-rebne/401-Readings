## Xamarin

- Xamarin is a platform for building multi-platform apps using .NET
- Supports Windows, iOS, and Android
- Manages communication of shared code, translating it for different platforms based on underlying platform code
- Provides managed environment providing memory management garbage collection etc
- Enables extreme reusability across platforms, preventing excessive use of multiple languages
- Apps compile into native app packages
- Android:
  - Compiles to an intermediate language
  - Then compiles to native assembly upon the application launching
- iOS:
  - Fully converted before launch into native code
- Xamarin.Forms provides a UI framework for creating Xamarin apps
- Interfaces are created in XAML files, which work similarly to Razor Pages

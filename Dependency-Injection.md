## Dependency Injection

- Design pattern built to allow classes (usually controllers specifically) to require other objects
- This allows classes and objects to require very specific criteria, while remaining open-ended for flexible implementation
- Often dependencies are built on interfaces, which allows a broad range of objects to be passed in, but which all contain necessary functionality
- Often dependencies can be chained, to ensure a strong structure of reliance
